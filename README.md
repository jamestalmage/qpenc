# Q-Sys Plugin Encryption Tool

QPEnc is a web-based tool for protecting the source code of QSC Q-Sys Lua plugins.

It performs RSA-based encryption in-browser using the **node-forge** library, such that unprotected plugin source code never leaves the user's computer.

The tool is hosted on Github Pages and may be accessed at [locimation.github.io/qpenc](https://locimation.github.io/qpenc/).
